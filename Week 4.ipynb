    "##                           For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a concept Burmese restauranter who wants to explore opening an authentic Burmese restaurant in Toronto area. The idea behind this project is that there may not be enough Burmese restaurants in Toronto and it might present a great opportunity for this enterpreneur who is based in Canada. As Burmese food is very similar to other Asian cusines, their enterpreneur is thinking of opening this restaurant in locations where Asian food is popular . With the purpose in mind, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this enterpreneur and I am designing this project to help him find the most suitable location."
